## Total Score: 85 / 100

Sequelize dependencies were not added to the project. 10 points were deducted for this.
Otherwise, things seem to work well.  That said, the package.json file is for
a different project.  I'm not sure if this was intentional or not.  You have commit
hooks that were preventing me from adding the grade.   Further there
is a lot of unused code in here.  So still you get a good grade but I need
to account for these other issues.
