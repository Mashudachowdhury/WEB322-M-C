## Feeback

It looks like this one may have been rushed a bit. The code looks like
it was somehow merged but there are conflicts that are not resolved so the
code does not run. Pay attention to details in naming. INDEX.js should be index.js (this is a common convention). I will gove partial marks for the code that is there but unless it runs I can't give full credit.

If you are struggling with Git let me know and maybe we can have an extra session. It is important to learn.
